    <h1>Timbre</h1>
    <p>
        The collection and access of music has become one of the defining features of modern, common computer usage, and singlehandedly molded the current face of pocket computing.
        And yet, almost all widely used music collections give the user a mere handful of options to control and access their music. Why is that acceptable?
    </p>
    <p>
        The easy answer is that it isn't. Timbre is designed with user control first in mind. No more of your music player telling you where to store your music.
        No more tossing your tunes out because it didn't match their syncing standards. No more putting up with rudimentary search functions built on the criteria that they think is important.
